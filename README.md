Vim-dotfiles
============
My vim setup and dotfile. The goal with this setup is to be able to switch machine/accounts and just clone out my fully fledged development environment.

Setup
=====
To setup the environment simply run ./boostrap.sh and you're ready to rock n' roll. Providing you've already got macvim or just vim installed.

Installing Vim
==============
Well there are many ways to do that. And google will probably tell you the right answer for your platform.

__On a debian linux__

You can write `sudo apt-get install vim-nox`

__On OSX__ 

You'll probably want the macvim package. Which can be found at [this link](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)
